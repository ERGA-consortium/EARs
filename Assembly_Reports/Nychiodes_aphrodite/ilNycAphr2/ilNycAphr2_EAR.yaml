Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 12
  Contamination notes: '"We removed a total of 49 contaminant scaffolds/contigs detected
    with BTK and FCS-GX. As FCS its faster, it was used to obtain the blobplot shown."'
  Other observations: '"We curated the hifiasm primary. Curation made 4 cuts in contigs,
    1 break at a gap and 3 joins. We both sex chromosomes, the Z chromosome and the
    W. The mitogenome was assembled with FOAMv0.5 into a single circular contig of
    15,485 bp. Note that the MT is not present in the assembly under review and it
    will be added just before the ENA upload."'
