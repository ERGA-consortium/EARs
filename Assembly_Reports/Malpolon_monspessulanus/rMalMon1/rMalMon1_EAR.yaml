  Other observations: '"Report after trying to address the concerns of expert review
    of an initial curation effort. For this particular species we decided to scaffold
    and curate after the hypo polishing step rather than following purge_dups as we
    do for most species. We adopted this strategy because we noticed that we were
    missing all of the W chromosome from our final scaffolded assembly after running
    purge_dups. However upon alignment of the sequences eliminated by purge_dups against
    NR, we found that they all aligned to the W chromosome of another Sauropsida (Vipera
    ursinii) from the southern Mediterranean that diverged from the Montpellier snake
    roughly 38 MYA . We also used a recent publication on this snake from 2023 (https://www.iris.unina.it/ret
    rieve/19087cf1-7fb4-4df2-8eb2-ff00e72c3809/2023_Mezzasalma%20et%20al_Eur%20Zool%20J_C
    omparative%20cytogenetics%20Hemorrhois%20and%20Malpolon.pdf) to help guide us
    on the number of chromosomes we should expect. Expert curation helped us infer
    that the W chromosome is actually incomplete with loss of signal along the diagonal
    between many of the scaffolds that make it up. This also made it hard to put these
    scaffolds in the proper order and orientation. We selected the most contiguous
    region to be SUPER_W and all the other SUPER_W-mapping regions being labeled as
    Unlocs. We share a folder with the pretext file and two saved states. In the second
    save state we just put W and Z next to one another."'
