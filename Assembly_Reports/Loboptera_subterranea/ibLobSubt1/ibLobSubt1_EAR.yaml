Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 7
  Contamination notes: '"Several sequences corresponding to to an intracellular fat
    body endosymbiont (Blattabacterium) were removed. In a couple of these cases the
    symbiont sequence were found and remvoved from super scaffolds (SUPER_9 and SUPER_X).
    In most other cases these sequences span several smaller scaffolds that were fully
    removed. Moreover, after our internal curation we still found that the following
    scaffolds, which will be removed from the final version of the assembly also contain
    symbiont (or other) types of contamination: scaffold_30, scaffold_59, scaffold_96,
    scaffold_85, scaffold_48,scaffold_39, scaffold_61, scaffold_21, scaffold_55, scaffold_45
    and scaffold_49. These have already been removed from the blobtools plot included
    in the report"'
  Other observations: '"The original pre-curation assembly was already quite good
    even though our HiC data contained a higher than desirable proportion of Cis read
    pairs < 1kb. Interestingly contrary to most other CNAG projects, in this case
    the ONT data derived from the homomorphic sex (female XX) and the HiC data was
    derived from the heteromorphic sex (XY). We apoloize but our pretext was not run
    with the -nosort option so that the few unlocs were placed at the end. However
    after the review we will build a pretext in which the SUPER scaffolds are kept
    together. This final EAR report includes one modification suggested by the reviewers,
    which consisted of the inverting the contig at the end of SUPER_8. The report
    is therefore the same except for the busco and gfastats outputs. The -nosort-
    pretext was shared with the save state that was shared with the reviewers."'
