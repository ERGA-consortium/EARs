  Other observations: '"The assembly of Catocala nymphagoga (ilCatNymp1) is based
    on 61X PacBio data and 410X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/).The assembly process
    included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm,
    removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications
    using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 146 contigs
    were identified as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 4.9
    Mb (with the largest being 327Kb). Additionally, 565 regions totaling 22 Mb (with
    the largest being 0.293 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed.
    The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 2 haplotypic
    regions were removed, totaling 536 Kb(with the largest being 0.303 Kb). Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size. Z chromosome was
    identified by comparison with the Catocala promissa genome assembly"'
