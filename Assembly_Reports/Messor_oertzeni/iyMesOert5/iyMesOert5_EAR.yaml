  Other observations: '"The assembly of Messor oertzeni (iyMesOert5.1) is based on
    42X PacBio data and 242X of Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total,
    7 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 0.410 Mb (with
    the largest being 0.103 Mb). Additionally, 66 regions totaling 6.311 Mb (with
    the largest being 0.524 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed.
    The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 7 haplotypic
    regions were removed, totaling 3 Mb (with the largest being 0.914 Mb). Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
