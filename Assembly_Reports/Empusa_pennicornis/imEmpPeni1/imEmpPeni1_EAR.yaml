  Other observations: '"The assembly of Empusa pennicornis (imEmpPeni1.1) is based
    on 71X PacBio data Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. No contigs were found to be
    contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral). Additionally, 140 regions totaling
    30.4 Mb (with the largest being 7.6 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications
    and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary
    assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. Chromosome-scale scaffolds
    confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
