Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 27
  Contamination notes: '"No contaminations was detected with FCS-GX."'
  Other observations: '"PacBio reads were subsampled to 60X. Reads were assembled
    with hifiasm (yield: 306M, N50: 6.4Mb). FCS-GX detected no contaminations. Purge_dups
    removed 285 contigs (31.3Mb). HiC data is of a decent quality 41.7M UU read pairs
    with 15% +40Kb length information. Yahs was used to scaffold the contigs (yield:
    275Mb, sN50: 15.7Mb). The curation revealed many large coverage drops (from 60X
    to 5-7X) at adjacent contigs within many chromosomes. Therefore all shrapnel contigs
    with the same repeat motif and coverage drops were marked as haplotiogs (removed
    contigs: 143). The current map still has coverage drops (from 60X to 10-15X).
    After discussing this issue in the assembly_curation slack channel, I did not
    trimm back these motifs. Apparently those satellites/heterochromatin regions can
    have up 75% lower coverage in Bombus species."'
