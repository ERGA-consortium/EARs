Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 9
  Contamination notes: '"No clear contaminants were found. However, we observed that
    BlobTools produces best hits to species other than molluscs in a small percentage
    of the assembly. Upon closer scrutiny of some unlocs or unplaced scaffolds matching
    other taxa, we found that many of these sequences actually either do match mollusca
    sequence but with lower scores or match several different unrelated taxa. We suspect
    that the main issue is that the mollusca databases are quite incomplete, and most
    data represents a limited number of organisms that could be evolutionarily distant
    from this species"'
  Other observations: '"The curation process was complicated by the fairly poor quality
    of the Hi-C data we received, resulting in a sparser pretext map (approximately
    3.5 million valid pairs, including cis >= 1kb and trans. per Gbase of sequence)
    compared to most projects with better Hi-C libraries. However, the pre-scaffolded
    NextDenovo assembly was already quite good, which helped us generate a draft assembly
    that meets most of the stringent EBP requirements. In this final version of the
    EAR report we addressed all of the reviewer concerns and produced a new pretext
    map and assembly based on that. The blobtools plot was not modified as that was
    deemed not to be necessary."'
