Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX found a single bacterial fragment, tiara found a couple
    of bacteria and one archaea contigs. Additional short contigs removed based on
    coverage."'
  Other observations: '"Sample is recorded as male and the observed karyotype (n=16,
    X0) is consistent with the literature. Assembly was performed with hifiasm using
    HiC data with the --h1/--h2 parameters. The collapsed p_ctg was selected based
    on N50/N90 and L50/L90 stats. purge_dups removed too many large contigs despite
    the cutoffs being very clear, causing 30 loss in complete BUSCOS. So, instead,
    I used the purge_dups classification together with BUSCO and tiara/FCS-GX reports
    to manually remove any contigs flagged by purge_dups that did not contain any
    BUSCOs (eukaryota, metazoa, arthropoda, or insecta from odb10), as well as flagged
    contaminants."'
