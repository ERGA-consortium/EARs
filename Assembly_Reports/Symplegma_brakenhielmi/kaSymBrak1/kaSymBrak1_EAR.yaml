Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 219
  Contamination notes: '"315 small sequences were removed as contaminants; in addition,
    2 large scaffolds (SUPER_12, SUPER_16) were classified as Arthropoda. However,
    they were not removed because their coverage and GC content were consistent with
    the rest of the genome, and they showed no Hi-C contacts with other scaffolds."'
  Other observations: '"The assembly of species Symplegma brakenhielmi (kaSymBrak)
    is based on 169X long read ONT data and 104X Arima HiC data generated as part
    of the ERGA initiative via the BGE project. The assembly process included the
    following steps: ONT reads shorter than 3 kb were filtered out, thus the remaining
    reads -for a total of ~108 Gb- were assembled using Necat with polishing performed
    using NextPolish. Contigs were subsequently filtered with purge_dups to remove
    haplotigs. Scaffolding was performed by aligning Hi-C reads to the purged contigs
    using the Omni-C mapping pipeline, followed by YaHS for scaffold construction.
    Contamination was checked using BlobTools. The scaffolds were processed through
    curationpretext pipeline to generate contact map, which was manually improved
    using PretextView. The presence of a mitochondrial genome contig/scaffold was
    not assessed. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in
    order of size."'
