  Other observations: '"The assembly of Somatochlora meridionalis (ioSomMeri1.1) is
    based on 29X PacBio data and 169X of Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the
    European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via
    the Biodiversity Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/).
    The assembly process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation
    with Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total,
    14 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 3.926 Mb (with
    the largest being 1.620 Mb). Additionally, 1832 regions totaling 129.562 Mb (with
    the largest being 1.031 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed.
    The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 3 contaminant
    sequences and 17 haplotypic regions were removed, totaling 0.292 Mb and 12.431
    Mb (with the largest being 0.128 Mb and 1.277 Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds
    confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
