  Other observations: '"The assembly of PRIMULA HIRSUTA (ddPriHirs2) is based on 37X
    PacBio data and 126X Omni-C Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 10 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 4 Mb (with the largest
    being 2.7 Mb). Additionally, 1,492 regions totaling 53 Mb (with the largest being
    993,547 pb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial
    genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and
    manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 30 haplotypic regions
    were removed, totaling 54,740,569 pb (with the largest being 14,250,946 pb). Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
