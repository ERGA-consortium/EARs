  Contamination notes: '"The BTK pipeline detected 530 contaminants, 7 no-hit (coverage
    and GC) and 523 belonging to the following Phylum: Bacillota (336), Bacterioidota
    (177), Actinomycetota (3), Chordata (2), Pseudomonadota (1), Streptophyta (1),
    Uroviricota (1). These contaminants have been removed from the assembly. In addition,
    5 scaffolds shorter than 68K contain partial or complete mitogenome insertions.
    They will be removed from the reviewed assembly before ENA upload (I already checked
    that BUSCO and QV will stay the same)."'
  Other observations: '"Hifiasm produced a primary assembly with 9 superscaffolds
    holding telomeres at both sides. HiC belongs to a different individual (iqOecDulc5)
    but also a male. One of the 9 supper-scaffolds was identified as the X chromosome
    based on the coverage. Both, the contact map and the telomere locations, strongly
    support a haploid number of 9. The curation was minimal, we just placed scaffolds
    larger than 119K into SUPER_1 using the multimaps pretext (mq=0). They seem to
    be centromeric repeats that can fit nearby a gap but they are impossible to order
    and orient with confidence. Regarding to the mitochondrial genome, this was assembled
    with FOAM into a single circular contig of 17,493 bp."'
