  Other observations: '"The assembly of Homalothecium mandonii (cbHomMand10) is based
    on 242X PacBio data and 87X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total,
    117,724 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral),
    totaling 5,525.781 Mb (with the largest being 12.259 Mb). Additionally, 689 regions
    totaling 15.958 Mb (with the largest being 0.086 Mb) were identified as haplotypic
    duplications and removed. Mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally,
    the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During
    manual curation, 2,088 contaminant sequences were removed, totaling 102,136,336
    pb (with the largest being 7,115,672 pb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed
    by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
