  Contamination notes: '"Contamination report for assembly labelled hap1; Total length
    of scaffolds removed: 797,121 (0.1 %); Scaffolds removed: 37 (1.6 %); Largest
    scaffold removed: (71,029); FCS-GX contaminant species (number of scaffolds; total
    length of scaffolds): Mitochondrion (37; 797,121)"'
  Other observations: '"Assembly was Hi-C phased; original contigs were filtered from
    bacterial contamination based on tiara results; for hap1 there were 8 rounds of
    yahs with read remapping; for hap2 there were 3 rounds of yahs with read remapping;
    The order and orientation of scaffolds within the following regions is uncertain:
    Chromosome 1 between approximately 20.97-76.37Mb; Chromosome 2 between approximately
    24.36-58.04Mb; Chromosome 3 between approximately 27.29-50.90Mb; Chromosome 4
    between approximately 38.17-49.74Mb; Chromosome 5 from the start to approximately
    32.83Mb; Chromosome 6 between approximately 42.17-47.45Mb; Chromosome 7 between
    approximately 20.53-29.70Mb; Inversions between haplotypes were observed in the
    following locations: Chromosome 1 between approximately 98.76-104.39Mb; Chromosome
    2 between approximately 70.2-100.2Mb; Chromosome 3 between approximately 12.06-26.96Mb"'
