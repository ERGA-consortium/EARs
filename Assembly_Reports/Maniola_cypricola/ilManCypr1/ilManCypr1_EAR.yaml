Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 680
  Contamination notes: '"We found four small scaffolds with bacterial contaminants,
    two of which were labelled and removed using pretextview and the rapid curation
    scripts. The other two will be removed after the reviewing process."'
  Other observations: '"We selected the primary assembly for this genome because neither
    haplotype achieved a cN50 of 1 Mb. Although purgeDups was used to manage duplicated
    regions, we subsequently reintroduced a substantial portion of the REPEAT labelled
    purged sequences in an attempt to recover the W chromosome, but this effort was
    unsuccessful. The curation process was relatively complex, requiring approximately
    680 edits per gigabase. Across two rounds of manual curation, we removed 63 haplotigs.
    We also identified and labelled an additional haplotig in the PretextView map
    (mq0) that we have shared for review. This haplotig had been intentionally removed
    in an earlier iteration but was reintroduced in the final curated assembly because
    it had been contigged into a region containing a BUSCO gene. The haplotig was
    positioned in a region showing no clear HiC contacts to SUPER_24 and was therefore
    moved to the chaff. It also lay adjacent to a smaller segment aligning to SUPER_6,
    which contains the aforementioned BUSCO gene that had been lost during haplotig
    removal. We subsequently reassigned this short segment to SUPER_6. Note that we
    are sharing to save_states of our mq0 pretext map curation effort. We removed
    an additional 46 haplotigs after reviewers comments. Futhermore we labelled an
    additional haplotig we had missed in SUPER_1 and made some sequencerearrangements
    in SUPER_22. These changes will be implemented after the second round of reviewing."'
