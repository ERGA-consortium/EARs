Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 9
  Contamination notes: '"No contaminations were detected with FCS-GX."'
  Other observations: '"PacBio reads were subsampled to 60X. Reads were assembled
    with hifiasm (yield: 488M, N50: 49.1Mb, 176 contigs). FCS-GX detected no contaminations.
    Purge_dups was run on the contigs but only the the dups.bed file was used in the
    manual curation step, as it removed to much sequence and telomere motifs. Due
    to the low HiC quality (2.8M cis-read pairs >40Kb) the scaffolding was manually
    done in the first manual curation round. In this step the information from tiara,
    mitohifi, blobtools and purge_dups was used and 110 contigs (15M) were removed.
    SUPER_8 and SUPER_11 had a very low coverage profile - roughly half coverage.
    A synteny analysis with GCA_958496175, GCA_958496155, GCF_905475395.1 and GCA_020423425.1
    suggests that SUPER_8 is the X chromosome. Super_11 is the Y chromosomes. Furthermore,
    the chromosome structure seems to be very stable within these insects (6 "closely"
    related species). All of them suggest the following joins: SUPER_5 AND SUPER_7
    (both telomere motifs available), SUPER_2 AND SUPER_10, SUPER_6 and SUPER_9 (one
    telomere motif). Then these weird repeats (centromers?) are always within the
    chromosomes."'
