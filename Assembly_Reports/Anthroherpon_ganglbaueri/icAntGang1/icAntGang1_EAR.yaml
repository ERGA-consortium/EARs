Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 66
  Contamination notes: '"Protobacteria contaminants were found in two scaffolds and
    removed with the pipeline NCBI FCS GX v Galaxy Version 0.5.5+galaxy1. Scaffolds
    that are flagged as contaminants by BlobToolKit were confirmed with FCS output
    table and with contact in the map as non-contaminants. Contact for scaffolds was
    also confirmed using HiGlass"'
  Other observations: '"Only one X chromosomes was found with alignement with close
    relatives Leptodirus hochenwartii and Catops nigricans"'
