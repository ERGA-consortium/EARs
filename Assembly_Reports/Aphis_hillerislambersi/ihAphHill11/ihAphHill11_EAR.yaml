Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 20
  Contamination notes: '"Contaminations were identified and removed with FCS-GX (removed:
    760 contigs, 24.3M). Mitochondrial genome was removed from the assembly."'
  Other observations: '"PacBio reads were assembled with hifiasm (yield: 509M, N50:
    37.7Mb, 850 contigs). FCS-GX detected several contaminations which where removed
    (yield: 485M, N50: 50.4Mb, 90 contigs). Purge_dups was run to remove haplotypic
    duplications (purged: 62 sequences, 38.8Mb remaining assembly: yield: 446M, N50:
    48.4Mb, 28 contigs). The HiC quality is really suboptimal (just 130K cis read
    pairs >40Kb) and 4 individuals were used for the HiC sequencing (see comments
    in assembly_curation slack channel from 16th October 2025) Due to the low number
    of contigs and the low HiC quality the scaffolding was done manually in the manual
    curation step. Obvious contig misjoins (see old slack message) where removed based
    on off-diagonal HiC signals, on coverage, and by investigating PacBio read alignments
    in IGV. The newer Hifiasm version (0.25.0-r726) created far less contig errors
    compared to the older version back in October 2025. Synteny analysis with 5 chromosome-scale
    Aphis assemblies were used to confirm the overall chromosome structure and the
    X-chromosome."'
