Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"Analyses with FCS-GX and BTK did not detect contaminants
    in the assembly."'
  Other observations: "\"Our best assembly was haplotype 2 obtained with hifiasm.\
    \ We will upload this assembly as a contig-level primary assembly to ENA. Contigs\
    \ are large and almost chromosome level. However, we could not obtain a Hi-C library\
    \ for this genome, so it was not scaffolded with YaHS or curated using Hi-C. We\
    \ could not confirm is a T2T assembly due to the lack of close reference and telomere\
    \ peaks at both ends of the largest scaffolds (\u2021 16.7 Mb). Illumina was used\
    \ only to build a combined meryl database with the ONT and estimate genome-size.\
    \ Mitogenome was not assembled.\""
