  Other observations: '"The assembly of Macrothele cretica (qqMacCret1) is based on
    19.7X PacBio data and 92X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 4 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 1.613 Mb (with the largest
    being 1.279 Mb). Additionally, 1161 regions totaling 239.165 Mb (with the largest
    being 8.15 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial
    genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and
    manually improved using Pretext. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C
    data were named in order of size. Sexual chromosomes renamed X1 to X11 according
    to length."'
