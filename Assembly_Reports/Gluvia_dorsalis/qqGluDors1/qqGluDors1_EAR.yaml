  Contamination notes: '"BTK detected 3 contaminant scaffolds matching bacteria (nt
    database) and they were discarded. Scaffold_12 was considered a false positive
    contaminant and retained (has no matches in nt and a short hit to Rotifera in
    uniprot). All other sequences were assigned to phylum Arthropoda by BTK. The complete
    mitochondrial genome was assembled into a single circular contig of 14,734 base
    pairs with excellent base accuracy using the FOAM pipeline (https://github.com/cnag-aat/FOAM).
    Following current SAC decission the MT is not included in this assembly version
    but it will be uploaded to ENA."'
  Other observations: '"Assemby Name: qqGluDors1.3. Comments: Genome Assembly obtained
    with CLAWS v2.1 pipeline (https://workflowhub.eu/workflows/567). Input assembly
    (nextdenovo.hypo1.purged) for HiC scaffolding was already highly contiguous (N50=47.35Mb),
    YaHS placed all contigs into 14 scaffolds. Manual curation involved localizing
    two scaffolds into SUPER_5 and SUPER_6 (made 2 cuts in contigs, 0 breaks at gaps
    and 4 joins). After EAR review, two SUPER (qqGluDors1.2) of approximately 7Mb
    were placed at SUPER_1 and SUPER_2 and tagged as Unloc. We could not tag the sex
    chromosome(s) as all SUPER show diploid coverage. Two scaffolds remain unplaced,
    they are repetitive and show multiple contacts to several SUPER. The hic_FullMap_link
    points to a folder containing two pretext maps with default and high resolution,
    respectively."'
