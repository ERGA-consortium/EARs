Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 45
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX found 1 bacterial contaminant in hap1 that was removed
    during curation. The curated diploid map is inside a shared folder."'
  Other observations: '"Sequencing was done by UNIBA, two different specimens were
    used: for ONT (qqLeiRupe1) and for Hi-C (qqLeiRupe9). Data was transfered to CNAG,
    where we assembled the genome. Our hifiasm assembly produced 2 haplotypes and
    we did a diploid curation. After review, curation made 71 interventions in total:
    21 cuts in contigs, 15 breaks at gaps and 35 joins. We assembled them into 11
    super-scaffolds what is consitent with the karyotype of the species (https//www.doi.org/10.14411/eje.2020.032).
    The sex chromosomes, likely homomorphic, were not identified. Mitogenome could
    not be assembled as we did not find reads matching the reference mitogenome"'
