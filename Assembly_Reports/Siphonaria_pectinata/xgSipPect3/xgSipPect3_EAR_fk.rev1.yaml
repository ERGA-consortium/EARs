  EBP quality code:
    collapsed: 6.7.Q55

Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 91
  Contamination notes: '"Few contigs (5, bacterial) were detected by FCS-GX or blobtoolkit
    and were removed."'
  Other observations: '"The assembly was produced with hifiasm using HiFi data. The
    resulting collapsetd *.bp.p_ctg.gfa was selected, screened for contamination with
    FCS-GX, and purged of haplotigs with purge_dups. Scaffolding was performed with
    YaHS. The HiC data was not of great use for curation, pairtools reported the fraction
    frac_cis_40kb+ being 0.042. 75 changes were made using PretextView."'
