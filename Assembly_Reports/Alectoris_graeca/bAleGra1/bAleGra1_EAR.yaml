Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"No presence of contaminants."'
  Other observations: '"purging was manually done to avoid removing of large fractions
    of microchromosomes, guided by purge_dups dups.bed file. Microchromosomes were
    identified with MicroFinder and scaffolded with the guidance of the alignments
    against the T2T chicken assembly. Microchromosomes 34-38 are probably not complete
    due to very low sequencing coverage 3-7X. Includes the mitochondrion (MT) - assembled
    with MitoHifi."'
