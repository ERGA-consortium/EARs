Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 468
  Contamination notes: '"The species was contaminated with Algae and Apicomplexa,
    during manual curation 560 scaffolds were removed, totaling 22.591041Mb (with
    the largest being 0.304681Mb)."'
  Other observations: '"The assembly of Schizoporella errata (tzSchErrt1) is based
    on 63,48X PacBio data and 282,50X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total,
    2501 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral),
    totaling 203.001 Mb (with the largest being 11.897 Mb). Additionally, 633 regions
    totaling 18.648 Mb (with the largest being 0.641 Mb) were identified as haplotypic
    duplications and removed. During manual curation, 53 haplotypic regions were removed,
    totaling 43.745424Mb (with the largest being 5.974177Mb). The telomeric pattern
    TTTGGGG was identified with TelFinder and used to generate the Pretext Telomeres
    tracks . Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order
    of size."'
