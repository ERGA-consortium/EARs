Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 0
  Contamination notes: '"No contaminations could be detected"'
  Other observations: '"Very good assembly. Indeed purge_dups and Yahs created a worse
    assembly as is truncated telomeres and the scaffolding cut off pieces. Most of
    the hifiasm contig assembly contained already full chromosomes with telomere motifs
    at both ends. Therefore I used the hifiasm assembly and scaffolded it manually
    with PretextView and the PixelSort option. Haplotigs were removed based on coverage
    and the purge_dups annotation. I could not identify the Z chromosome, as I could
    not find a turtle assembly with known sex chromosomes."'
