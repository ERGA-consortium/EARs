  Other observations: '"The assembly of CARABUS STAEHLINI (icCarStae2) is based on
    45X PacBio data and 210X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 71 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 3,705,613 pb (with the largest being 1,315,266
    pb). Additionally, 215 regions totaling 16,655,681 pb (with the largest being
    1,136,177 pb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial
    genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and
    manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 2 haplotypic region was
    removed, totaling 1,019,594 pb (with the largest being 597,145 pb). On chromosome
    2, unlocs could be located in the centromere at approximately 8 Mb, but their
    exact order and orientation remain uncertain. Similarly, on chromosome 11, unlocs
    could be located at 6.2 Mb. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data
    were named in order of size."'
