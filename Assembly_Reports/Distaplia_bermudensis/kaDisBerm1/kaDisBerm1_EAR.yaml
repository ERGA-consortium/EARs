  Other observations: '"The assembly of species Distaplia bermudensis (kaDisBerm)
    is based on 247X long read ONT data and 105X Arima Hi-C data generated as part
    of the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) via the Biodiversity Genomics Europe
    project (BGE). The assembly process included the following steps: ONT reads shorter
    than 3 kb were filtered out, thus the remaining reads -for a total of ~116 Gb-
    were assembled using Necat with polishing performed using NextPolish. Contigs
    were subsequently filtered with purge_dups to remove haplotigs and obtain a more
    accurate, non-redundant assembly. Scaffolding was performed by aligning Hi-C reads
    to the purged contigs using the Omni-C mapping pipeline, followed by YaHS for
    scaffold construction. Contamination was checked using BlobTools. The scaffolds
    were processed through sanger_tol/curationpretext pipeline to generate the contact
    map, which was manually improved using PretextView. The presence of a mitochondrial
    genome contig/scaffold was not assessed. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed
    by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
