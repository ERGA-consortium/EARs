  Other observations: '"The assembly of Formica gagates (iyForGaga1) is based on 72X
    PacBio data and Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference Genome
    Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/).The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS.
    In total, 5 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral),
    totaling 2.8 Mb (with the largest being 1.4 Mb). The mitochondrial genome was
    assembled using OATK but the sequence obtained is linear. Finally, the primary
    assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation,
    5 haplotypic regions were removed,totaling 0.903 Mb (with the largest being 0.539
    Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of
    size"'
