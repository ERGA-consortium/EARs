  Contamination notes: '"The PAcBIO HIFI data used in this project was derived from
    two pooled individuals of this species. Blobtools allowed us to identify several
    scaffolds, mostly small, that were made up largely of bacterial and fungal sequences.
    We proceeded to remove 1790 of these scaffolds. In fact 36% of the sequence corresponded
    to bacterial & fungal contamination. Removing the contaminated scaffolds from
    the assembly not only did not increase the number missing busco genes but also
    actually improved not only the busco accuracy but all other assembly quality metrics
    as well (N50, QV...). The assembly was curated initially prior to filtering out
    the contaminants. The resulting -scrubbed- assembly was re-analyzed with Blobtools
    and we were able to find 7 additional short scaffolds made up mostly of bacterial
    sequence. These will be removed from the assembly submitted for review"'
  Other observations: '"The mix of individuals we assembled appears to consist of
    one male and one female specimen, as suggested by the observation that one chromosome
    exhibits approximately three-quarters HiFi coverage. To assemble the genome of
    a beetle derived from two pooled individuals, we applied a customized set of Hifiasm
    parameters aimed at maximizing contiguity while accommodating subtle haplotype
    variation. Although the sample contained only two individuals, we specified --n-hap
    4 to allow for the resolution of sub-haplotypes and structural differences that
    might exist within or between individuals. The manually set --hom-cov 51 corrected
    for inaccurate peak detection in coverage histograms, ensuring proper classification
    of homozygous regions. To reduce noise and improve overlap scoring in this low-diversity
    context, we used --min-hist-cnt 5 and increased overlap sensitivity with -N 150.
    To further optimize for a more contiguous primary assembly, we introduced controlled
    randomness in overlap scoring using --n-perturb 30000 and --f-perturb 0.3, which
    helped resolve ambiguities in highly similar regions and prevented premature fragmentation.
    These perturbation settings allowed Hifiasm to better distinguish between nearly
    identical sequences, improving graph resolution and contig extension. Only the
    primary assembly achieved a contig N50 greater than 1 Mb, making it the most suitable
    for downstream analysis. Therefore our focus shifted toward curating this mixed
    primary assembly to produce a high-quality, representative genomic sequence. This
    is v2 of the EAR after external reviewing. Several sequence re-arrangements were
    a made and 17 haplotigs were found and removed from the final assembly. The rev2
    version of this EAR contains only a couple of minor changes from the previous
    version to address one of the reviewers concerns"'
