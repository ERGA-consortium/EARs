Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"Lots of fungal sequences and one insect detected. These were
    removed before scaffolding"'
  Other observations: '"PacBio and HiC data were from different specimens and the
    HiC was made of a mix of male and female parts of the plant. There were a lot
    of retained duplicates after the initial contig assembly and purge-dups was found
    to over-purge, removing quite a few genes. As such, large haplotids were manually
    identifed during curation and purge-dups was run after curation to remove JUNK,
    REPEAT and HIGHCOV sequenes. The 500kb mitochria and 100kb chloroplast were also
    assembled using oatk. There were a lot of fragments from the mito and chloroplast
    in the genome that were manually removed."'
