  Contamination notes: '"No contaminants detected. All sequences were assigned to
    the order Lepidoptera using blobtoolkit. The complete mitochondrial genome was
    assembled into a single circular contig of 15,247 base pairs with excellent base
    accuracy using the FOAM pipeline (https://github.com/cnag-aat/FOAM)."'
  Other observations: '"Genome Assembly obtained with CLAWS v2.1 pipeline (https://workflowhub.eu/workflows/567).
    Input assembly (nextdenovo.hypo2.purged) for HiC scaffolding was already highly
    contiguous (N50=18.8Mb), YaHS made 1 break and 6 joins. Manual curation was not
    required. We tagged the Z SUPER based on its haploid coverage while the autosomal
    SUPER were numbered by descending scaffold size. SCAFFOLD_32: is 58Kb long and
    remains unplaced, it shows inespecific but weak contacts with several SUPER. 18.70%
    of its length is occupied by repeats, of which 12.79% are interspersed repeats.
    It has low mappability and this explains why diagonal contact are only visible
    when we allow multimappings (mq=0). The blastn hits of scaffold_32 correspond
    to autosomes of other Lepidotera genomes reassuring our decission of including
    it in the assembly. WARNING: The shared contact map (.pretext) of the curated
    assembly shows all scaffolds sorted by length. Thus most of the unloc are towards
    the end and separated from their corresponding SUPER. This will be fixed in future
    versions of CLAWS."'
