Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 1
  Contamination notes: "\"Repeated attempts to run BlobTools were unsuccessful, so\
    \ we used an alternative tool called FCS-GX (Foreign Contamination Screen \u2013\
    \ Genome eXclusion), to identify contaminated scaffolds. In this species, hap1\
    \ contained 496 contaminated scaffolds with diverse bacterial sequences. Of these,\
    \ seven scaffolds exceeded 1 Mbp. Hap2 contained 149 contaminated scaffolds, two\
    \ of which were also longer than 1 Mbp. All contaminated scaffolds from both haps\
    \ were flagged as contaminants during a preliminary curation step using pretextview,\
    \ and were subsequently removed from the analysis in the pretextview file shared\
    \ for review.\""
  Other observations: '"This assembly was generated using Hifiasm with ONT data. Given
    the high quality of both haplotypes, curation was performed in diploid mode. We
    are sharing the curated haplotypes extracted from the diploid curation map. Intentionally,
    we selected the aligned SUPER scaffolds with the fewest gaps to construct hap1.
    Only minor modifications were made to the yahs-scaffolded assemblies. No sex chromosome
    could be identified. The rev1 assembly addresses the reviewers comments: 1- rearrangement
    of SUPER_9 of HAP2 to fix a large assembly error, 2- ensure that the SUPER sscaffolds
    of HAP1 and HAP2 follow the same order."'
