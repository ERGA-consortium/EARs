  Other observations: '"The assembly of Arachnocephalus vestitus (iqAraVest5) is based
    on 22X PacBio data and 104X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/).The assembly process
    included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm,
    removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications
    using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 853 contigs
    were identified as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 124
    Mb (with the largest being 5.1Mb). Additionally, 2173 regions totaling 194 Mb
    (with the largest being 1.3 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and
    removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary
    assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation,
    6 haplotypic regions were removed, totaling 4.6 Mb (with the largest being 2.2
    Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of
    size"'
