  Interventions/Gb: 4
  Contamination notes: "\"Repeated attempts to run BlobTools were unsuccessful. While\
    \ investigating the cause, we utilized an alternative tool, FCS-GX (Foreign Contamination\
    \ Screen \u2013 Genome eXclusion), which identified several of the smallest chromosomes\
    \ (all under 3.6 kilobases) as contaminated with human sequence (scaffolds 337,\
    \ 343, 346, 347, 348, and 351). These scaffolds will be excluded from the final\
    \ assembly.\""
  Other observations: '"We selected the primary assembly for this species due to its
    superior contiguity and fewer gaps compared to either haplotype. The sequenced
    sample was from an XY male. Our analysis identified a putative pseudoautosomal
    region (PAR), which we positioned at the beginning of chromosome X. We also detected
    several haplotigs. In the case of the repeat-rich Scaffold_9 (painted), we tentatively
    flagged certain sequences as unlocalized sequences, even though these could be
    haplotigs pending reviewer feedback. The Pretext map we are sharing has not yet
    been remapped, but all putative chromosomes have been painted and identified haplotigs
    have been tagged. We have also included the mq0 Pretext map for your reference.
    The statistics (busco,merqury,gfstats) were obtained on the provisionally curated
    assembly generated from the mq10 pretext which we shared."'
