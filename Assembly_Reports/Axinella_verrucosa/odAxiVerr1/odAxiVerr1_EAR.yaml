  Other observations: '"The assembly of AXINELLA VERRUCOSA (odAxiVerr1) is based on
    97X PacBio data and 161X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dup and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 703 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 71,633,625 pb (with
    the largest being 3,087,110 pb). Additionally, 186 regions totaling 15,617,024
    pb (with the largest being 834,842 pb) were identified as haplotypic duplications
    and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary
    assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation,
    42 contigs were identified as contaminants, totaling 917,636 pb (with the largest
    being 58,401 pb) and 3 haplotypic region was removed, totaling 2,339,198 pb (with
    the largest being 1,680,985 pb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C
    data were named in order of size."'
