Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 39
  Contamination notes: '"Contaminations were identified and removed with FCS-GX (removed:
    4 contigs, 150Kb). Mitochondrial genome was removed from the assembly."'
  Other observations: '"PacBio reads were assembled with hifiasm. FCS-GX detected
    a few contaminations which where removed. Purge_dups was run to remove haplotypic
    duplications. But it removed to much sequence and even the Busco score dropped
    significantly. Therefore the Busco gene set was used to guide the purging. Afterwards
    Tiara was used to remove archaea|bacteria|organelle hits. Due to time issues and
    compute cluster down-time the scaffolding was done manually within the curation
    step. This worked well as the input assembly consisted of just 230 contigs. The
    curation revealed more contig misjoins than usual (76 contigs cuts were necessary).This
    is probably caused by the large heterozygosity (1.6%). Several large-scale structural
    haplotypic variations can be seen in the HiC-map. The X-chromosome was identified
    by synteny analysis with other Acrididae (e.g. GCF_021461395.2_iqSchAmer2) assemblies,
    but also the PacBio read coverage showed a 1n coverage pattern."'
