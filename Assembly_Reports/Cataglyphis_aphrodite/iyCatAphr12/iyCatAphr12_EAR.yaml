Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 5
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX detected 2 contigs: Candidatus Nanopelagicus limnes
    and Tsukamurella tyrosinosolvens"'
  Other observations: '"Straightforward assembly. PacBio HiFi reads were subsampled
    to 60x coverage. HiFiasm (yield: 219Mb, N50: 2.5M) + FCS-GX (removed 2 contigs,
    25Kb) + purge_dups (yield: 210Mb, N50: 2.5M) + yahs + curation. No major issues.
    I could not identify any sex chromosome. The PacBio coverage is uniformly distributed
    over all chromosomes and I could not find any other ant assembly with known sex
    chromosomes. In a second curation round the assembly was mapped to GCF_021464435.1
    and GCF_021464445.1 which revealed that scaffold_2 and scaffold_9 needed to be
    split. Therefore the final chromosome number is now 26."'
