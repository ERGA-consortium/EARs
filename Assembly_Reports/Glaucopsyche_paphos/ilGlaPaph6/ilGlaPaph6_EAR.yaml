Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 0
  Contamination notes: '"Wolbachia was assembled (present in both haps) and removed
    (labeled in pretextview) before running Blobtools, which detected no presence
    of any further contaminants. Mitochondrial genome has not been assembled, yet.
    Not detected in the assembly."'
  Other observations: '"Haplotypes were curated separately. Pre-curation hap1 had
    some haplotigs an minor corrections (Curation made 7 cuts in contigs, 3 breaks
    at gaps and 4 joins). Hap2 did not require any corrections. Just a few unlocs
    made. After curation, a new hap1 was made with best (fewest gaps) SUPER per chromosome
    chosen. The new hap2 assembly was given the more gappy scaffolds. Assignment of
    the Z was based on alignment to FR990042.1 https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/GCA_905404095.1."'
