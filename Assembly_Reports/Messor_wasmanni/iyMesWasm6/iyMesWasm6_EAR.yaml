  Other observations: '""The assembly of Messor wasmanni (iyMesWasm6) is based on
    41X PacBio data and 234X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 2 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 0.062 Mb (with the largest
    being 0.045 Mb). Additionally, 144 regions totaling 6.464 Mb (with the largest
    being 0.254 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial
    genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and
    manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 4 haplotypic regions
    and 5 contaminant sequences were removed, totaling 0.478 Mb and 0.37 Mb respectively,
    (with the largest being 0.2 Mb and 0.284 Mb).Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed
    by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
