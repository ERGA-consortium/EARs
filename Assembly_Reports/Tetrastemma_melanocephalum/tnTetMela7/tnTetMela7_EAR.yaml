Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"There were about 170 proteobacteria sequences totalling 3Mb
    identified by FCS-GX and then a further 21 scaffolds removed by blobtools corresponding
    to various fungi and bacteria totalling a further 3Mb. The swissprot databases
    seems to classify a number of scaffolds as arthropod, likely due to the lack of
    sequences in this lineage."'
  Other observations: '"There were a lot of retained haplotigs in this assembly, likely
    due to the high heterozygosity rate of 4%. Hi-C was from another individual, so
    the hifiasm+hic assembly was not possible. Just over 30Mb of sequence was manually
    removed as haplotig."'
