  Contamination notes: '"BlobTools identified more than 300 small scaffolds as potential
    contaminants, primarily corresponding to bacteria, with additional matches to
    fungi and chordates. With the exception of a couple, these contaminated scaffolds
    were removed from the assembly provided for review. The elimination of these putative
    contaminants did not seem to affect the BUSCO scores"'
  Other observations: '"This extensively modified version of our curated assembly
    was made possible thanks to the expertise of the EAR reviewers, who recognized
    that many of the SUPER scaffolds were, in fact, chromosome arms. For the most
    part, the reviewers subsequently assembled these themselves. The heterochromatic
    regions between the purported chromosome arms were assembled with a low degree
    of confidence due to the inherent difficulties of assembling repetitive regions.
    This second review of the assembly addresses a few more issues that were spotted
    by the main reviewer"'
