  Other observations: '"The assembly of Zygaena laeta (ilZygLaet5.1) is based on 44X
    PacBio data and 354X of Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 1 contig of 0.016
    Mb was identified as contaminant (bacterial). Additionally, 503 regions totaling
    37.471 Mb (with the largest being 0.451 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications
    and removed. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved
    using Pretext. During manual curation, 7 haplotypic regions and 1 contaminant
    sequence were removed, totaling 3.478 Mb and 0.027 Mb (with the largest being
    0.611 Mb and 0.027 Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were
    named in order of size."'
