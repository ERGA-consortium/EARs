  Other observations: '"The assembly of DOLBINA ELEGANS (ilDolEleg1) is based on 42X
    PacBio data and 246X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 270 regions totaling
    6,430,096 pb (with the largest being 164,404 pb) were identified as haplotypic
    duplications and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally,
    the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During
    manual curation, 2 haplotypic region were removed, totaling 609,538 pb (with the
    largest being 164,404 pb) and 2 scaffolds were identified as contaminants and
    removed. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order
    of size. The sex chromosome Z was identified by alignment with ilSphPina1.1. Lepidoptera
    Z chromosomes are well preserved, allowing their identification by synteny. Furthermore,
    it can be inferred that the specimen is male, given that all chromosomes are uniformly
    covered."'
