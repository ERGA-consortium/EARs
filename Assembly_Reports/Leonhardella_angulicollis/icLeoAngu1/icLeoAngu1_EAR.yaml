  Contamination notes: '"The PAcBIO HIFI data used in this project was derived from
    a mix of three individuals for this species. Blobtools allowed us to identify
    several scaffolds, mostly small, that were made up mostly of bacterial and sometimes
    fungal sequences. We proceeded to remove 1989 of these scaffolds with no detriment
    to the busco score (5 Missing BUSCOs pre- and post- elimination of contaminants)
    even though the contaminated sequences comprised 19% of the total sequence length.
    The assembly was initially curated prior to filtering out the contaminants. The
    -scrubbed- assembly was shown to be free of all contaminants. This assembly was
    subsequently remapped with the HiC data and this is the map we are submitting
    for review."'
  Other observations: "\"In order to curate the assembly, and given the HiC library\
    \ was suboptimal, we used both the mq_0 and mq_10 mappings side by side. The save_states\
    \ in the directory shared for review correspond to the mq_0 mappings. Please refer\
    \ to save state 3 for review purposes. The shared pretextmap corresponds to a\
    \ second round of curation, using HiC alignments to the contaminant-free (scrubbed)\
    \ assembly. It includes a few additional haplotigs we found in the scrubbed assembly.\
    \ To assemble the genomic sequence of a pooled sample comprising three beetle\
    \ individuals, we employed a tailored set of parameters in Hifiasm to account\
    \ for the unique characteristics of the dataset. Given the relatively low heterozygosity\
    \ observed in the GenomeScope2 plot, we specified --n-hap 3 to reflect the presence\
    \ of three distinct haplotypes while still accommodating their high similarity.\
    \ The --hom-cov 44 parameter was manually set to correct for inaccurate peak detection\
    \ in Hifiasm\u2019s default histogram analysis, ensuring proper separation of\
    \ homozygous and heterozygous regions. To reduce noise from low-frequency k-mers\
    \ and improve coverage estimation, we used --min-hist-cnt 10, while --f-perturb\
    \ 0.1 introduced slight randomness to overlap scoring, helping resolve ambiguities\
    \ in highly similar regions. Additional parameters such as -N 120 increased the\
    \ sensitivity of overlap detection, which is crucial when assembling genomes with\
    \ subtle inter-individual variation. We also included the --primary flag to generate\
    \ a simplified, non-redundant assembly output, focusing on the most representative\
    \ contigs. Together, these settings allowed us to balance the need for haplotype\
    \ resolution with the practical constraints of assembling a genome from a genetically\
    \ (fairly) homogeneous pool. Based on input from the EAR reviewers, we subsequently\
    \ determined that most of the SUPER scaffolds were, in fact, chromosome arms.\
    \ This hypothesis first emerged when we aligned our assembly with those of two\
    \ closely related species with high-quality genomes\u2014Leptodirus hochenwartii\
    \ and Catops nigricans. A closer inspection of the mq_10 Pretext map further supported\
    \ this interpretation, revealing fairly clear evidence of scaffold joins consistent\
    \ with chromosomal arm structure. These comparative alignments also enabled us\
    \ to identify the putative X chromosome within our assembly. Additionally, the\
    \ reviewers helped us detect several haplotigs and guided the reorganization of\
    \ multiple SUPER scaffolds to improve structural accuracy. This EAR reflects review\
    \ #2 of the curation, which involved re-orienting some of the chromosome arms\
    \ and fixing a clear inversion. This rev3 of the EAR addresses some chromosome\
    \ arm orientation issues with three of the SUPER scaffolds (5,9 and 10)\""
