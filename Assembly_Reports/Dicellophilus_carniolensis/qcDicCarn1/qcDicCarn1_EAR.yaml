Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX detected some bacterial fragments in the hifiasm p_ctgs
    matching Wolbachia and indicative of a complete genome but without circularized
    contigs. We collected the fragments and used these as reference for read mapping
    with minimap2, then extracted mapped reads with samtools (-F 2052) and re-assembled
    them with hifiasm with default settings. This process yielded a circular contig
    of 1.3Mb. Allele typing using PubMLST (https://pubmlst.org/bigsdb?db=pubmlst_rmlst_seqdef_kiosk)
    revealed a close match to Candidatus Mesenet endosymbiont of Agriotes lineatus,
    which is a proposed new genus in the Anaplasmataceae family."'
  Other observations: '"The assembly was produced with hifiasm and the *p_ctg.fa was
    selected. The assembly was decontaminated with FCS-GX, and haplotigs purged with
    purge_dups. Scaffolding was performed with YaHS. Mitochondria was assembled with
    Oatk. HiFi and Hi-C data come from distinct individuals."'
