EBP metrics:
  EBP quality code:
    collapsed: 7.8.Q60

Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 60
  Contamination notes: '"72 contigs were identified as bacterial and removed, totaling
    3.9 Mb in size, with the longest being 239 Kb in length"'
  Other observations: '"80 allelic duplications were removed, totaling 47 Mb in size.
    The expected size was 1.2 Gb, but we ended up with an assembly of 5 Gb. This explains
    the relatively low coverage of the PacBio data (20x). However, we stopped at this
    point since the contig N50 was well above 1 Mb. As for the Hi-C, we sequenced
    two libraries, but again, the coverage is low."'
