  Other observations: '"The assembly of species Lucanus tetraodon (icLucTetr) is based
    on 150X long read ONT data and 85X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: ONT reads shorter than 3 kb were filtered
    out, thus the remaining reads were assembled using Necat with polishing performed
    using NextPolish. Contigs were subsequently filtered with purge_dups to remove
    haplotigs and obtain a more accurate, non-redundant assembly. Scaffolding was
    performed by aligning Hi-C reads to the purged contigs using the Omni-C mapping
    pipeline, followed by YaHS for scaffold construction. Contamination was checked
    using BlobTools, and no contaminants were detected. The scaffolds were processed
    through sanger_tol/curationpretext pipeline to generate the contact map, which
    was manually improved using PretextView. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed
    by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
