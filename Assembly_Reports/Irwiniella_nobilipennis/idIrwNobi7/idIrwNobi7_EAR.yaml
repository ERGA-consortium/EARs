Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 13
  Contamination notes: '"Removed one Pseudomonas contig from initial 12 contigs. This
    corresponds to the shoulder on left of het/1n peak in merqury plot. Due to this,
    genomescope did not estimate genome size accurately. Loss in k-mer completeness
    due to contaminant removal."'
  Other observations: '"No Hi-C was produced for this species (funding ran dry, I
    think). The draft assembly was aligned to idTheUnic2.1 (GCA_949987705) and idTheNobi1.1
    (GCA_963855945) assemblies, which confirmed order of contigs inferred based on
    repeats types and read overlaps. The pre-curation WGA is shown in the image (instead
    of contact map). 2 contig joins made in SUPER_2 and 3 contig joins made in SUPER_X
    with 0 gap characters. The result is all sequence placed into T2T chromosomes."'
