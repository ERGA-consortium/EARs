Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"No presence of contaminants."'
  Other observations: '"many interventions on the contig level were necessary. Three
    manual curation rounds were done with the following interventions round 1: (Curation
    made 31 cuts in contigs, 15 breaks at gaps and 47 joins), round 2: (Curation made
    50 cuts in contigs, 41 breaks at gaps and 49 joins) and round 3: (Curation made
    16 cuts in contigs, 18 breaks at gaps and 17 joins). The final blobtools plot
    is misleading in my point of view. FCS reported nothing on contig assembly and
    the blobtools classfification is only based on the diamond hits. Blast reported
    not a single alignment. A manual web-blast for some of the putative contaminations
    did not report anything either. Super_5 has an odd HiC signal and a 20Mb region
    where the coverage drops to half. But there is not any haplotig off-diagonal signal
    visible. In a previous curation round I had SUPER_5 split into two chromosomes
    separated at the 32Mb gap, but that did not look good either."'
