Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 233
  Contamination notes: '"28 sequences were removed as contaminants. In addition, one
    large scaffold (SUPER_12) was classified as Arthropoda. However, it was not removed
    because its coverage and GC content were consistent with the rest of the genome,
    and it showed no Hi-C contacts with other scaffolds."'
  Other observations: '"The assembly of species Microcosmus polymorphus is based on
    352X long read ONT data and 211X Arima HiC data generated as part of the ERGA
    initiative via the BGE project. The assembly process included the following steps:
    ONT reads shorter than 1 kb were filtered out, thus the remaining reads for a
    total of ~121 Gb were assembled using Necat with polishing performed using NextPolish.
    Contigs were subsequently filtered with purge_dups. Scaffolding was performed
    by aligning HiC reads to the purged contigs using the Omni-C mapping pipeline,
    followed by YaHS for scaffold construction. Contamination was checked using BlobTools.
    The scaffolds were processed through sanger_tol/curationpretext pipeline to generate
    the contact map, which was manually improved using PretextView. The presence of
    a mitochondrial genome contig/scaffold was not assessed. Chromosome-scale scaffolds
    confirmed by HiC data were named in order of size."'
