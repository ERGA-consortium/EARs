  Interventions/Gb: 123
  Contamination notes: '"Two contigs were identified as bacterial sequences (47,294
    bp and 54,341 bp), and seven contigs were identified as viral sequences (Max size
    = 75,569 bp, cumulative size = 387,150 bp). All nine contigs were removed before
    scaffolding."'
  Other observations: '"Here we retained the Nextdenovo assembly. Note that Hifiasm
    generated an assembly of 782Mbp with a high N50 (21Mb) and a low N90 (<50Kb).
    Several ploidies were observed in the Androsace genus, with 10 chromosomes (Weiss
    (2021), "Chromosome number and ploidy level of Androsace maxima (Primulaceae)
    in Austria", https://www.zobodat.at/pdf/NEIL_1_0177-0180.pdf). Here, we reconstructed
    40 chromosomes (clearly 4 sets of 10 chromosomes based on the Hi-C map), suggesting
    a tetraploid or an octoploid genome for Androsace saussurei. If the genome is
    tetraploid, it is unusual as the assembler reconstructed complete maternal and
    paternal alleles, indicating high heterozygosity. In contrast, if the genome is
    octoploid, it indicates near homozygosity. We can clearly see regions with higher
    coverage that may indicate gene conversions between the homologous chromosomes,
    which would require additional techniques for complete assembly. Tetraploidy was
    also suggested by Smudgeplot, and SNPs showed few variations, supporting the tetraploid
    hypothesis. The twenty most complete chromosomes will be submitted as the reference
    haplotype, and the other twenty as the alternate haplotype."'
