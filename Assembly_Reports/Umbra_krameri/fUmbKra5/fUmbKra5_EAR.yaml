Curator notes:

  Contamination notes: '"Contaminants were removed using NCB FCS and blobtools information.
    The main contaminant was Arthropoda, scaffold were removed if no contact was present
    in the map. The big contamination seen in the blob, is relative to two of our
    species chromsome, SUPER_2, SUPER_5 and SUPER_17. Those scaffolds were not removed
    since the contact on the map was good and constant in those 3 scaffold."'
  Other observations: '"None"'
