Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 8
  Contamination notes: '"The BTK pipeline detected 1 contaminant scaffold (scaffold_136)
    in the pre-curated assembly. However this scaffold was kept, as it is a false
    positive containing 1 arachnida_odb10 Complete BUSCO and contacts stronly with
    a chromosome (scaffold_31 or SUPER_32 in curated assembly). For this report, we
    just show the blob plot of the precurated assembly, actually the only difference
    with the curated is the number of total scaffolds (184 instead of 187 after curation)."'
  Other observations: '"Our best genome assembly was obtained running hifiasm with
    the Hi-C phasing option and then scaffolding the primary assembly with YaHS. Although
    the sequenced specimen was a female, during curation we could not detect the sex
    chromosomes. In fact, the lack of distinguishable sex chromosomes is consistent
    with previous studies in the Euscorpius genus (10.15671/HJBC.2019.269). Regarding
    to the mitochondrial genome, this was assembled with FOAM into a single circular
    contig of 15,340 bp."'
