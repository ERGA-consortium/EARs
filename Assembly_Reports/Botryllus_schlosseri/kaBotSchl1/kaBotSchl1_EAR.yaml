  Other observations: '"The assembly of species Botryllus schlosseri (kaBotSchl) is
    based on 135X long read ONT data and 141X Dovetail OmniC data generated as part
    of the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/)
    via the Pilot project. The assembly process included the following steps: ONT
    reads shorter than 3 kb were filtered out, thus the remaining reads for a total
    of ~81 Gb were assembled using Necat with polishing performed using NextPolish.
    Contigs were subsequently filtered with purge_dups to remove haplotigs and obtain
    a more accurate, non-redundant assembly. Scaffolding was performed by aligning
    Omni-C reads to the purged contigs using the Omni-C mapping pipeline, followed
    by YaHS for scaffold construction. Contamination was checked using BlobTools.
    The scaffolds were processed through sanger_tol/curationpretext pipeline to generate
    the contact map, which was manually improved using PretextView. The presence of
    a mitochondrial genome contig/scaffold was not assessed. Chromosome-scale scaffolds
    confirmed by Omni-C data were named in order of size."'
