  Other observations: '"The assembly of Sisyphus schaefferi (icSisScha5) is based
    on 115X PacBio data and 580X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. The mitochondrial
    genome has not been assembled, and mitochondrial contigs may be present in the
    assembly. No contigs were found to be contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral).
    Additionally, 301 regions totaling 15.045 Mb (with the largest being 2.354 Mb)
    were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 2 haplotypic
    regions and 18 contaminant sequences were removed, totaling 0.315 and 0.412 Mb
    respectively, (with the largest being 0.181Mb and 0.060 Mb). Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
