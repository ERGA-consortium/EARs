  Other observations: '"The assembly of Bolivaria brachyptera (imBolBrac2) is based
    on 30X PacBio data and Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/).The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, no contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral). Additionally, 679 regions totaling
    185 Mb (with the largest being 8.4 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications
    and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary
    assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation,
    3 haplotypic regions were removed, totaling 2.3 Mb (with the largest being 1.2
    Mb. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size.
    The X chromosome was identified thanks to comparison to another insecta genomes."'
