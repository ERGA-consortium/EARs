  Other observations: '"The assembly of Orosanga japonica (ihOroJapo4) is based on
    23,75X PacBio data and 63,98X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total,
    22 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling
    4.26 Mb (with the largest being 1.482 Mb). Additionally, 587 regions totaling
    58.428 Mb (withthe largest being 2.709 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications
    and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. During manual
    curation, 1 haplotypic regionswere removed, totaling 0.172694Mb (with the largest
    being 0.172694Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named
    in order of size. Based on the long read coverage and HiC signal, we identified
    the X chromosome and tag it accordingly."'
