Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 7
  Contamination notes: '"No contamination was detected by Blobtoolkit which was run
    on the diploid assembly"'
  Other observations: '"This assembly was obtained with Hifiasm from ONT data. Given
    the high quality of both haplotypes, curation was done in diploid mode. We have
    shared the curated and painted pretext map corresponding to the diploid assembly
    (after curating each hap separately and combining them). The sex SUPER was initially
    mistakenly labelled as X, but this is corrected in the round corresponding to
    diploid curation. The Z was confirmed by alignment to other evolutionarily close
    species. This EAR includes the modifications suggested by the reviewers and we
    are sharing a pretext map for each hap generated by our method of diploid curation.
    Note that we had to remove the hap2 merqury from the yaml since we continually
    obtained an error when adding it. The code seems to assume both haps are in the
    same folder. Since we handled both haps separately in this review and there are
    not mixed haps we obtained an error."'
