Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX detected 13 small (< 100kb) contigs matching Apilactobacillus
    micheneri and timberlakei, but no complete genome could be recovered for those
    bacteria."'
  Other observations: '"The assembly was produced with hifiasm in Hi-C mode, decontaminated
    with FCS-GX, and haplotigs purged with purde_dups. Scaffolding was performed with
    YaHS. The resulting scaffolds are mostly gapless, with 16 scaffolds matching the
    known karyotype for this genus (n=16), and containing all of the identified BUSCOs
    (99.1%, hymenoptera_odb10). These likely represent the euchromatic arms of each
    chromosome, and accordingly most contain telomeric sequences on one end only.
    The assembly also contains a large number of scaffolds that couldn''t be assigned
    to chromosomes, likely representing the heterochromatic and highly repetitive
    fraction of this genome. Assembly size is roughly consistent with the k-mer genome
    size estimate. Mitochondria was assembled with Oatk."'
