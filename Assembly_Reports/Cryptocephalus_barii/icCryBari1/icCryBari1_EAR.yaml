  Contamination notes: '"The sequence of a known endosymbiont was identified and excluded
    from the final assembly."'
  Other observations: '"The assembly of species Cryptocephalus barii (icCryBari) is
    based on 189X long read ONT data and 170X Dovetail OmniC data. The assembly process
    included the following steps: ONT reads shorter than 3 kb were filtered out, thus
    the remaining reads -for a total of ~102 Gb- were assembled using Necat with polishing
    performed using NextPolish. Contigs were subsequently filtered with purge_dups
    to remove haplotigs and obtain a more accurate, non-redundant assembly. Scaffolding
    was performed by aligning Omni-C reads to the purged contigs using the Omni-C
    mapping pipeline, followed by YaHS for scaffold construction. Contamination was
    checked using BlobTools. The scaffolds were processed through sanger_tol/curationpretext
    pipeline to generate the contact map, which was manually improved using PretextView.
    The presence of a mitochondrial genome contig/scaffold was not assessed. Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Omni-C data were named in order of size. Chromosome X was
    identified."'
