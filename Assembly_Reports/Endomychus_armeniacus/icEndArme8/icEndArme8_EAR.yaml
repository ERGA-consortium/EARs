  Other observations: '"The assembly of ENDOMYCHUS ARMENIACUS (icEndArme8) is based
    on 133X PacBio data and 143X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation withHifiasm,
    removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications
    using purge_dups and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 5 contigs were
    identified as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 2,499,279 pb (with the largest
    being 1,018,873 pb). Additionally, 406 regions totaling 36,877,930 pb (with the
    largest being 390,577 pb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed.
    The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 1 haplotypic
    region, totaling 618,187 pb and 19 contaminants, totaling 3,216,312 pb (with the
    largest being 501,195 pb) were removed. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by
    Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
