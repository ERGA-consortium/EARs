  Other observations: '"The assembly of SCARDIA BOLETELLA (ilScaBole1) is based on
    166X PacBio data and 501X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. No contamination was detected.
    But, 192 regions totaling 6 Mb (with the largest being 996,406 pb) were identified
    as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled
    using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved using
    Pretext. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order
    of size and the telomere pattern found is TTAGG."'
