    hap2: 8.8.Q70

Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"5,851,380 bp contained in 75 sequences were considered contaminats
    by FCS-GX and removed from hap1. Additionally, 2,128,985 contained in 32 sequences
    were also considered contaminants and removed from hap2. The longest removed contigs
    for hap1 and hap2 were 263,942 and 160,176 bp, respectively."'
  Other observations: '"This genome assembly was produced by assembling ONT data with
    Hifiasm and then scaffolding with Yahs. Given the good quality of both haplotypes,
    curation was made in diploid mode and we are planning to submit both haplotypes
    to the ENA. Curation made 2 cuts in contigs, 5 breaks at gaps and 40 joins. 3
    sex chromosomes were identified during curation based on half coverage, given
    their structure and based on some of the existant knowledge in spiders, we believe
    that they correspond to 3 X chromosomes. The mitogenome was successfully assembled
    with FOAM."'
