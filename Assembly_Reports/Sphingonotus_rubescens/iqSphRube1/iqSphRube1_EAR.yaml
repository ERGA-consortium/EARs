Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 27
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX and Blobtools detected no presence of contaminants.
    .Mitochondrial genome was removed from the assembly"'
  Other observations: '"The PacBio reads were subsampled to 40X. HiFiasm created a
    primary collapsed assembly of 13Gb, and HiC-phased haplotypes of 9Gb each. Therefore
    the haplotype-phased assemblies were used for this species. For each haplotype
    purge_dups, FCS-GX and yahs was run seperately. When running purge_dups with default
    parameter 545Mb (hap1) and 746Mb (hap2) of sequence was removed. This also resulted
    in the loss of some busco genes. Therefore first: contigs larger than 1Mb and
    second: contigs that were marked as hap but contained single Busco genes were
    kept. The purge_dups bed annotations was later used in the manual curation step
    too, in order to decide if e.g. a REPEAT tagged contigs needs to be removed. The
    manual curation revealed many haplotype misplacements and HapHic was used to guide
    to guide those corrections. Just for clarification: HapHiC was not error-free
    either - the correction of contig errors was sub-optimal. Therefore I decided
    to stick to yahs scaffolds, where I already invested some time to curate those.
    There are still some weird repetitive HiC patterns left, which look odd to me.
    E.g.: a large inversion in h2s7 at 638M - 668M, but when trying to remove the
    potential dup the HiC map looks much worse as the main diagonal has a pretty decent
    signal including the dup."'
