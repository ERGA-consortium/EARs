Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 0
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX detected 17 contigs represetning the following species:
    Spiroplasma endosymbiont of Danaus chrysippus, Candidatus Dactylopiibacterium
    carminicum, Spiroplasma endosymbiont of Lariophagus distinguendus and Wolbachia
    endosymbiont (group A) of Rhinocyllus conicus"'
  Other observations: '"PacBio HiFi reads were subsampled to 60x coverage. HiFiasm
    (yield: 383Mb, N50: 27.9M) + FCS-GX (removed 17 contigs, 17.5Mb) + purge_dups
    (yield: 368Mb, N50: 37.8M) + yahs. The HiC data is of a very bad quality, i.e.
    only 258K read pairs span a region of +1Kb. Therefore yahs was run without contig
    error correction. In the curation the pretext map was barely usable. Three larger
    repetitive contigs were removed due to very low PacBio covarage. Three more joins
    were done based on "slightly" increased pixel density and the orientation is based
    on the telomere motifs. I tried to map against other chromosome-scale assemblies
    but I could not find close relatives ones. These ones: GCA_009761765.1_ASM976176v1,
    GCA_032883995.1_ASM3288399v1, GCA_039619475.1_ASM3961947v1, GCA_039619475.1_ASM3961947v1
    and BGE:Scarites_abbreviatus show barely any hit. I attached a telomere plot to
    show that we potentially achieved chromosomes-scale, as almost all of the 8 longest
    scaffolds have telomere motifs at both ends."'
