  Other observations: '"The assembly of Mylabris quadripunctata (icMylQuad2) is based
    on 43,88X PacBio data and 242,75X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Nextdenovo, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. No contigs
    were found to be contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral). Additionally, 174
    regions totaling 16.062 Mb (with the largest being 0.338 Mb) were identified as
    haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using
    OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext.
    Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size.
    Using comparative genomics analysis with Mylabris sibirica, Hycleus marcipoli,
    Tenebrio molitor, and Harmonia axyridis; we have been able to identified chromosome
    X and tag it accordingly."'
