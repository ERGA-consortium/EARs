  Other observations: '"The assembly of Knipowitschia mrakovcici (fKniMra) is based
    on 184,48X PacBio data and 459,73X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total,
    1 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling
    0.027 Mb (with the largest being 0.027 Mb). Additionally, 247 regions totaling
    25.344 Mb (with the largest being 0.986 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications
    and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. During manual
    curation, 2 haplotypic regions were removed, totaling 0.574978Mb (with the largest
    being 0.524169Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named
    in order of size."'
