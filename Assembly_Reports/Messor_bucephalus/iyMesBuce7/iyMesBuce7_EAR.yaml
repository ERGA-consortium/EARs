Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX detected 3 small (< 100kb) contigs matching Tunavirus
    ISF002, Phage NBSal001, and Mixta mediterraneensis."'
  Other observations: '"The assembly was produced with hifiasm, decontaminated with
    FCS-GX, and haplotigs purged with purge_dups. Scaffolding was performed with YaHS
    and the scaffolds were analysed with blobtools for the presence of residual contaminants.
    Although no contaminants were found, scaffolds with extreme coverages (<50x and
    >140x) were filtered out of the assembly. The curated assembly has 21 putative
    chromosomes likely representing the euchromatic arms of each chromosome. The assembly
    also contains a large number of scaffolds that could not be assigned to chromosomes,
    likely representing the heterochromatic and highly repetitive fraction of this
    genome. Mitochondria was assembled with MitoHiFi."'
