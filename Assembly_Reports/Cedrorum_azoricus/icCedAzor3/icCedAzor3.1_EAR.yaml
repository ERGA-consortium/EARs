  Other observations: '"The assembly of CEDRORUM AZORICUS (icCedAzor3) is based on
    43X PacBio data and 189X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS (and no contig correction). In
    total, 9 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral),
    totaling 11 Mb (with the largest being 2 Mb). Additionally, 730 regions totaling
    427 Mb were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial
    genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and
    manually improved using Pretext. Manual curation was performed using the normal
    resolution map, and the genome was reviewed on the BGE GitHub with a normal resolution
    q0 map (find in this EAR.pdf). Every effort was made to improve this genome, but
    full confidence has not been reached. During manual curation, 4 haplotypic regions
    were removed, totaling 416,211 pb (with the largest being 156,079 pb). Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
