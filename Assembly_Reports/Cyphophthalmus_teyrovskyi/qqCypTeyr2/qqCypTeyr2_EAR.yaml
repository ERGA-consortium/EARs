Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX and Blobtoolkit identified 90 contigs as contaminants
    and they were removed from the assembly."'
  Other observations: '"Sequencing was done at UNIBA for to different specimens: qqCypTeyr2
    (HiFi) and qqCypTeyr8 (Hi-C). Assembly was performed by the CNAG. We obtained
    a contig level assembly as detailed. We first assembled the HiFi reads with Hifiasm
    and then ran purge_dups on it to collapse duplicated haplotigs and repeats. The
    Hi-C barely mapped to the purged assembly so scaffolding did not work. We did
    not assembled the mitogenome. We did not found evidences of contamination in the
    Hi-C or HiFi reads, and our QC of the HiC library shows <1% mapped reads and the
    few Cis Read Pairs mapping at distances shorter than 1kb"'
