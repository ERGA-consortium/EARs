  Other observations: '"The assembly of Frontinellina frutetorum (qqFroFrut6) is based
    on 35X PacBio data and Omni-C Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/).The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 26 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 5.8 Mb (with the largest
    being 2.3Mb). Additionally, 1,178 regions totaling 69 Mb (with the largest being
    1.1 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial
    genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and
    manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 5 haplotypic regions
    were removed, totaling 2.3 Mb (with the largest being 0.74 Mb). Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size"'
