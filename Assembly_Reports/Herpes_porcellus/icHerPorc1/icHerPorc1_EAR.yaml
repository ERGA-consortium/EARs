  Other observations: '"The assembly of species Herpes porcellus (icHerPorc) is based
    on 174X long read ONT data and 48X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) via the Biodiversity Genomics Europe project (BGE).
    The assembly process included the following steps: ONT reads shorter than 3 kb
    were filtered out, thus the remaining reads -for a total of ~152 Gb- were assembled
    using Necat with polishing performed using NextPolish. Contigs were subsequently
    filtered with purge_dups to remove haplotigs and obtain a more accurate, non-redundant
    assembly. Scaffolding was performed by aligning Hi-C reads to the purged contigs
    using the Omni-C mapping pipeline, followed by YaHS for scaffold construction.
    Contamination was checked using BlobTools. The scaffolds were processed through
    sanger_tol/curationpretext pipeline to generate the contact map, which was manually
    improved using PretextView. The presence of a mitochondrial genome contig/scaffold
    was not assessed. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named
    in order of size."'
