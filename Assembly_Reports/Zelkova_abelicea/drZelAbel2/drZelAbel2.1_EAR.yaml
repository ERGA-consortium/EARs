  Other observations: '"The assembly of ZELKOVA ABELICEA (drZelAbel2) is based on
    27X PacBio data and 90X Omni-C Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS.
    In total, 2 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 23 Kb
    (with the largest being 15 Kb). We did not use purge_dups to remove haplotype
    duplications, as it did not work properly on this genome. The mitochondrial genome
    was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually
    improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 47 haplotypic regions and 22 contaminant
    sequences were removed, totaling 29 Mb and 4 Mb, respectively (with the largest
    being 1.6 Mb and 1 Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were
    named in order of size."'
