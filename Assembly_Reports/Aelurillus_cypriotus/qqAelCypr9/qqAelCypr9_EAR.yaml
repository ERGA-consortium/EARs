Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 0
  Contamination notes: '"No contaminants were detected"'
  Other observations: '"We have decided to curate the primary assembly for this species
    as it contained only four gaps and it is about four times as contiguous as each
    of the haps (hap1 and hap2 have 28 and 36 gaps respectively). The sample that
    was sequenced corresponded to an XX female while the HiC data came from a male.
    This helped us identify the X chromosome. We further confirmed the sex chromosome
    by alignment to other species within the same Dionycha clade."'
