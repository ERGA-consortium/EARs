  Other observations: '"The assembly of ORTHOTRICHUM DIAPHANUM (cbOrtDiap4) is based
    on 90X PacBio data and 172X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Nextdenovo, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, and Hi-C-based scaffolding
    with YaHS. In total, 312 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial and
    virus), totaling 102,717,377 pb (with the largest being 1,315,266 pb). Additionally,
    215 regions totaling 16,655,681 pb (with the largest being 6,394,324 pb) were
    identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. Additionally, 209 regions totaling
    12,347,622 pb (with the largest being 297,312 pb) were identified as haplotypic
    duplications and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally,
    the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During
    manual curation, 14 scaffolds were identified as contaminants and removed. Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
