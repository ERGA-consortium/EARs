Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 9
  Contamination notes: '"found fragments of a trypanosoma sp. corresponding to a small
    unloc of SUPER_1 (SUPER_1_unloc_3) of length 184,352 bases, which was removed
    from the final assembly, now reflected in the pretext map which corresponds to
    the uncontaminated sequence."'
  Other observations: '"This is the version of the assembly after going through the
    ERGA reviewing process. Stats, merqury file and busco were obtained from the assembly
    without the contaminated short unloc scaffold. The post-curation contamination
    screening plot corresponds to the curated assembly before removal of the trypanosoma
    sp. sequence. WARNING: The shared contact map (.pretext) of the curated assembly
    shows all scaffolds sorted by length. Thus most of the unloc are towards the end
    and separated from their corresponding SUPER. This will be fixed in future versions
    of CLAWS"'
