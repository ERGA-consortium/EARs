Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"Decontamination was performed using NCBI FCS were maily proteobacteria
    contamiants were removed. Another step of decontamination was done based on diamond
    scores and blobtoolkit identification, it this step 1.3Gb of contaminants were
    removed."'
  Other observations: '"This is a contig level assembly. Despite the scaffolding the
    N50 is really low and is not possibile to procede with the curation"'
