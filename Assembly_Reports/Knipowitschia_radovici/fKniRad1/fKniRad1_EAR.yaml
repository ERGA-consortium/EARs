  Other observations: '"The assembly of Knipowitschia radovici (fKniRad1) is based
    on 40X ONT data and 489X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial ONT assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal of
    contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 58 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 1.501 Mb (with the largest
    being 0.088 Mb). Additionally, 3735 regions totaling 66.756 Mb (with the largest
    being 0.121 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. Mitochondrial
    genome was assembled using OATK. Genome submitted to the contig scale"'
