Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 15
  Contamination notes: '"We found a large bacterial sequence (+5Mb) corresponding
    to a species of proteobacter (pseudomonadota) which was removed (scaffold_15).
    Furthermore several other scaffolds (75) were removed when they were deemed to
    be largely made up of contaminants ascribed to different phyla (i.e. arthropoda,
    chordata, echinodermata , cnidaria, mucoromycota and rotifera)"'
  Other observations: '"Curation was a bit difficult due to a fairly low contiguity
    (2.8 Mb contig N50). We had to break one of the large yahs-assembled scaffolds
    (scaffold_4) as there was no support for it being a single scaffold but rather
    two. Some larger unplaced scaffolds/unlocs were not removed even if containing
    some contaminanting sequences since their removal would have resulted in a reduction
    in the number of busco mollusca & metazoa complete genes. Implemented all changes
    suggested by the EAR reviewer. The HiRes version of the pretext map was shared"'
