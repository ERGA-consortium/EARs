Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 4
  Contamination notes: "\"Repeated attempts to run BlobTools were unsuccessful. We\
    \ instead utilized an alternative tool, FCS-GX (Foreign Contamination Screen \u2013\
    \ Genome eXclusion), which identified three scaffolds as contaminated with bacterial\
    \ sequence. One scaffold appears to correspond to the full genome of the endosymbiont\
    \ Serratia marcescens. These contaminated scaffolds were removed prior to diploid\
    \ curation\""
  Other observations: '"This assembly was generated with Hifiasm using ONT data. Given
    the high quality of both haplotypes, curation was performed in diploid mode. In
    this report, only hap1 is shared. This haplotype is more complete than hap2, as
    it includes the full Z chromosome (originally in hap1) and the fragmented W chromosome,
    which was present in both hap1 and hap2 prior to diploid curation. After the reviewing
    process we agreed that SUPER_W_unloc_12 and SUPER_W_unloc_13 did not appear to
    be Unlocs of SUPER_W. They were moved to the Chaff and renamed scaffold_3 and
    scaffold_4. We also foind two other segments of SUPER_15 and SUPER_21 respectively
    that did not not seem to match specifically to these SUPERs and we also moved
    these to the chaff while renaming them scaffold_1 and scaffold_2"'
