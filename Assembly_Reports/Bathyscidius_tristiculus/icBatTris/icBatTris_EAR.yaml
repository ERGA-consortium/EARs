Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"No contamination was detected."'
  Other observations: '"This genome assembly was produced by assembling PacBio HiFi
    data from two different individuals with Hifiasm, purging with purge_dups and
    then scaffolding with Yahs. Curation made 27 cuts in contigs, 46 breaks at gaps
    and 47 joins. 44 haplotypic sequences, composing a total of 28,686,280 bp were
    identified and removed during curation. Mitogenome was successfully assembled
    with FOAM."'
