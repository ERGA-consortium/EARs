  Other observations: '"The assembly of HOLOTHURIA POLI (ehHolPoli1) is based on 48X
    PacBio data and 662X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio and Hi-C assembly generation with Hifiasm
    creating a dual assembly, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, and
    Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. Both haplotypes were curated, but only haplotype
    1 (HAP1) was retained for this EAR report. In total, 7 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 332,045 pb (with the largest being 181,308
    pb). The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 90 haplotypic
    region was removed, totaling 362,774,100 pb (with the largest being 56,148,590
    pb) and 14 were identified as contaminants."'
