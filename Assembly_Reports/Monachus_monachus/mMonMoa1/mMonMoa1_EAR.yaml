Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX and tiara detected no contamination."'
  Other observations: '"The Hi-C library for this species failed and it was not used
    in assembly or scaffolding. The hifiasm contigs were ordered and oriented through
    sequence alignments relative to the closest species available, Neomonachus schauinslandi
    (Hawaiian Monk Seal), using RagTag in scaffold mode. The contig-level assembly
    had very good stats already. We are reporting stats for the contig-level assembly
    (raw hifiasm contigs, pre-curation), and the curated RagTag scaffolds. Curation
    involved checking telomeres and coverage, RagTag scores for grouping, location
    and orientation, as well as visualizing synteny through protein alignments with
    N. schauinslandi. We have also prepared and checked Pretext maps with the Hi-C
    data but these are not very informative as you can see. In the final M. monachus
    scaffolds, 16 out of 17 putative chromosomes contain telomeres at both ends in
    proper orientation, the exception being scaf4. The 5'' telomere for scaf2 is not
    at the tip but present in window 30-40kb. All other telomeres are at the very
    end of scaffolds. Mitochondria was assembled with mitohifi. This individual has
    extremely low heterozygosity and GenomeScope2 with ploidy=2 was giving a genome
    size estimate of 1.2Gb, I think because of the apparent lack of a heterozygous
    peak, so we changed ploidy to 1 to get a better estimate."'
