Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"No contaminants were found with the pipeline NCBI FCS GX
    v Galaxy Version 0.5.5+galaxy1. Scaffolds that are flagged as contaminants by
    BlobToolKit were confirmed with FCS output table and with contact in the map.
    None were removed."'
  Other observations: '"Curation was done in two steps. 1)In a double haplotype contact
    map, the two haplotypes were checked to resolve haplotigs and construct an Hap1
    as complete as possibile. 2) The Curation was done only on the most complete haplotype,
    in this case Hap1."'
