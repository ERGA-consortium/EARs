  Other observations: '"The assembly of Scolopendra cretica (qcScoCret2.1) is based
    on 42X PacBio data and 125X of Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. No contigs
    were found to be contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral). Additionally, 720
    regions totaling 112.56 Mb (with the largest being 0.98 Mb) were identified as
    haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial genome was assembled using
    OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext.
    During manual curation, 22 haplotypic regions were removed, totaling 10.73 Mb
    (with the largest being 2.56 Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C
    data were named in order of size."'
