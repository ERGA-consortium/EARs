  Other observations: '"The assembly of species Botryllus gaiae (kaBotGaia) is based
    on 355X long read ONT data and 289X Arima HiC data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: ONT reads shorter than 3 kb were filtered
    out, thus the remaining reads -for a total of ~105 Gb- were assembled and polished
    using Necat. Contigs were subsequently filtered with purge_dups to remove haplotigs
    and obtain a more accurate, non-redundant assembly. Scaffolding was performed
    by aligning HiC reads to the purged contigs using the Omni-C mapping pipeline,
    followed by YaHS for scaffold construction. Contamination was checked using BlobTools.
    The scaffolds were processed through sanger_tol/curationpretext pipeline to generate
    the contact map, which was manually improved using PretextView. The presence of
    a mitochondrial genome contig/scaffold was not assessed. Chromosome-scale scaffolds
    confirmed by HiC data were named in order of size."'
