EBP metrics:
  EBP quality code:
    collapsed: 7.8.Q66

Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX detected four bacterial contigs matching Cardinium
    endosymbiont and totalling 1,438,579 bp. These were removed from the assembly."'
  Other observations: '"The assembly was produced with hifiasm and the collapsed *p_ctg.fa
    was selected. The assembly was decontaminated with FCS-GX, and haplotigs purged
    with purge_dups. Scaffolding was performed with YaHS. Mitochondria was assembled
    with MitoHiFi."'
