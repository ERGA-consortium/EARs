  Other observations: '"The assembly of Cotoneaster nebrodensis (drCotNebr1) is based
    on 20X PacBio data and 98X OmniC Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). This genome is decaploid
    and expected to have an AAABB structure. The assembly was performed using PacBio
    and Hi-C data, with the -n_hap parameter set to 2. Several tests were performed
    with this option, and only with this configuration were we able to retrieve the
    five chromosomes for each haplotype: in general, hap1 contains two A copies (often
    fused into a single scaffold) and one B chromosome, while hap2 contains one A
    and one B chromosome. The assembly process included the following steps: initial
    PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using
    Context, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. The mitochondrial and chloroplastic
    genomes were assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed
    and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 895 contaminant sequences
    were removed, totaling 38.13 Mb (the largest being 0.51 Mb). Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size (average size of
    the 3 A and 2 B chromosomes), and similarly, A and B copies were named according
    to their size. Note that the assembly contains more than the expected 5x17 = 85
    chromosomes, as the two expected B chromosome 1 copies are split into four chromosomes;
    consequently, the final assembly contains a total of 87 chromosomes."'
