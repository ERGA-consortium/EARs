EBP metrics:
  EBP quality code:
    hap1: 8.8.Q73
    hap2: 8.8.Q72

Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"463,602 bp contained in 5 sequences were considered contaminats
    by FCS-GX and removed from hap1. Additionally, 215,540 bp contained in 3 sequences
    were also considered contaminants and removed from hap2. The longest removed contigs
    for hap1 and hap2 were 113,622 and 87,503 bp, respectively."'
  Other observations: '"This genome assembly was produced by assembling ONT data with
    Hifiasm, phasing with Hi-C data, and then scaffolding with Yahs. Given the good
    quality of both haplotypes, curation was made in diploid mode and we are planning
    to submit both haplotypes to the ENA. Curation made 11 cuts in contigs, 5 breaks
    at gaps and 22 joins. The X chromosome was identified by WGA against iqPlaFalx.
    The mitogenome was successfully assembled with FOAM."'
