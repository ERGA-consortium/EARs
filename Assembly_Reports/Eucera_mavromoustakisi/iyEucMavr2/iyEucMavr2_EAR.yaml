Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 6
  Contamination notes: '"No contaminations were detected with FCS-GX."'
  Other observations: '"PacBio reads were subsampled to 50X. Reads were assembled
    with hifiasm (yield: 1003M, N50: 209Kb, 12561 contigs). FCS-GX detected no contaminations.
    Purge_dups removed 7301 contigs (379.4Mb). HiC data is of a decent quality with
    14M cis-reads pairs above 40Kb. Yahs was NOT used to join contigs into scaffolds
    as it oversplit many contigs (removed telomere motifs) and overjoined many shrapnel
    contigs. The current map still contains many shrapnel contigs that I could not
    unambiguously assign to any of the chromosomes. Super_18 looks still a bit odd
    also due to the large unlocalized contig. Some of the chromosomes e.g. SUPER_8
    and SUPER_11 have a weaker signal towards the end. I assigned the contigs based
    on a map without shrapnels shorter than 100K (4843 contigs) and at that time the
    signal was much clearer. The final map now has all shrapnels and therefore the
    signal is much ore diluted."'
