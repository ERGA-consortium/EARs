Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 144
  Contamination notes: '"234 contigs were excluded via FCS-GX. Though 900 more contigs
    are marked with the REVIEW label."'
  Other observations: '"The initial PacBio data set shows a very broad range of contamination/cobionts
    up to 14X. Therefore the PacBio reads were subsampled to 40X, which reduced the
    "erroneous" kmers to a normal fraction. The hifiasm assembly based on the subsampled
    reads was quite fragmented (4889 contigs, N50 4.5Mb). FCS-GX decontamination just
    removed 234 contigs (see contamination notes) and haplotype purging removed 1072
    (45.5Mb) additional contigs. The HiC data is of suboptimal quality (40M UU-read
    pairs with just 3% >40Kb resolution). Further contamination were filtered out
    by running tiara, purge_dups again, investigating the from FCS-GX review-tagged
    contigs, blobtoolKit, and by applying a GC filtering (>0.45) and PacBio coverage
    <5."'
