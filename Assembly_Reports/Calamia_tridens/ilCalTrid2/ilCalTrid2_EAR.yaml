  Other observations: '"The assembly of CALAMIA TRIDENS (ilCalTrid2) is based on 68X
    PacBio data and 132X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In
    total, 2 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 64,299
    pb (with the largest being 52,155 pb). We did not use purge_dups to remove haplotype
    duplications, as it did not work properly on this genome. The mitochondrial genome
    was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and manually
    improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 4 haplotypic region was removed,
    totaling 13,402,842 pb (with the largest being 6,868,000 pb). Chromosome-scale
    scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of size."'
