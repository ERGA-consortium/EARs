Curator notes:
  Interventions/Gb: 102
  Contamination notes: '"Partial viral hits (Streptomyces phage, 4 contigs, ~130Kb)
    and proteobacteria (Luteimonas saliphila, 1 contig, 25Kb) were detected with FCS-GX.
    Mitochondrial genome was removed from the assembly."'
  Other observations: '"PacBio reads were assembled with hifiasm (yield: 474M, N50:
    1.5Mb, 953 contigs). FCS-GX detected few contaminations. Purge_dups was run to
    remove haplotypic duplications (purged: 633 sequences, 90Mb remaining assembly:
    yield: 384M, N50: 2.4Mb, 360 contigs). Yahs was used to scaffold the contigs (
    --no-contig-ec was used to avoid over-cutting the contigs and the removal of telomere
    motifs). The HiC quality is suboptimal (just 2M cis read pairs >40Kb). It seems
    that this species potentially contains heterochromatin regions which show a much
    lower PacBio coverage profile and repetitive HiC interactions. At first I tried
    to assign more shrapnels as unlocalized contigs to the corresponding chromosomes,
    but then I removed those assignments again as the supports are very thin. I did
    a synteny analysis with iyMesOert5 and iyMesBuce7 and assigned a larger contig
    (previously chromosome 22) to SUPER_2. So I ended up with the expected 21 chromosomes."'
