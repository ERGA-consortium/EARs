  Other observations: '"Getting an assembly that was curatable was troublesome for
    this genome. In the end we have used an experimental tool in development that
    uses FastGA based alignments to look for syntenic units across the 4 haplotypes.
    This gave a version of the assembly that was curatable, although many phasing
    errors remained to be dealt with during curation. The sample is tetraploid (2n=32)
    and seems to be highly polymorphic as many rearrangements could be detected during
    curation. Haplotypic inversions were detected on:; Chromosome 1 from 33.40 to
    84.84 Mbp and from 50.98 to 84.84 Mbp; Chromosome 2 from 22.18 to 45.74 Mbp; Chromosome
    6 from 80.33 Mbp to the end; Chromosome 9 from 7.65 to 28.41 Mbp; Chromosome 10
    from 545 Kbp to 3.67 Mbp; Chromosome 12 from 55.32 to 61.14 Mbp; Chromosome 14
    from 31.51 to 55.14 Mbp; The HAP1 file has the curated chromosome-level assembly
    and the other 3 haplotypes are in HAP2 file as scaffold-level assemblies"'
