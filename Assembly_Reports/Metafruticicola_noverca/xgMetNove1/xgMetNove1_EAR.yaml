  Other observations: '"The assembly of Metafruticicola noverca (xgMetNove1.1) is
    based on 63X PacBio data and 29X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European
    Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity
    Genomics Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly
    process included the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with
    Hifiasm, removal of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic
    duplications using purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total,
    35 contigs were identified as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 1.8 Mb (with
    the largest being 647 Kb). Additionally, 11,422 regions totaling 2.14 Gb (with
    the largest being 5.1 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed.
    The mitochondrial genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 659
    haplotypic regions were removed, totaling 355.2 Mb (with the largest being 38.3
    Mb). Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order of
    size."'
