  Other observations: '"The assembly of MORIMUS ASPER (icMorAspe1) is based on 47X
    PacBio data and 105X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/). The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 6 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial), totaling 1,644,077 pb (with the largest being 1,548,558
    pb). Additionally, 388 regions totaling 36 Mb (with the largest being 2,794,973
    pb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial
    genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and
    manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 5 haplotypic region were
    removed, totaling 3,762,895 pb and 8 scaffolds were identified as contaminants
    and removed. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in order
    of size."'
