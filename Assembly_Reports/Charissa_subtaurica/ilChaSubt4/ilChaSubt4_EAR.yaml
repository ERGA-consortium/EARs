  Other observations: "\"The assembly of each haplotype for this species was nearly\
    \ telomere-to-telomere (T-to-T). Hap2 was slightly more contiguous than hap1\u2014\
    hap1 contained two gaps, whereas hap2 was gap-free. However, hap1 included the\
    \ SUPER scaffold identified as Z, as well as most of the W chromosome. To leverage\
    \ this, we created a pseudo-hap1 assembly by combining the entire hap2 assembly\
    \ with the Z and W scaffolds from hap1. We then remapped the Hi-C data against\
    \ this new combined assembly, which we designated as hap1. This resulted in a\
    \ T-to-T assembly, with the exception of SUPER_W, which retained two gaps. We\
    \ attempted to reorganize the SUPER_W sequences, but due to the high repetitiveness\
    \ of the region, our confidence in the scaffold's structural accuracy remains\
    \ low. We assigned the longest contig corresponding to W as the SUPER, and the\
    \ remaining fragments were labeled as Unlocs. A save_state of the Pretext map\
    \ has been placed in the shared folder for your review\""
