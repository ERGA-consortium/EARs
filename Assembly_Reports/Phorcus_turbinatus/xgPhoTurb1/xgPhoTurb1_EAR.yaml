  Contamination notes: '"BTK detected 817 putative contaminant scaffolds using nt,
    reference proteomes and 15 BUSCO databases. As the The mitogenome hit to Anopheles
    gambiae and a hit to Mytilus coruscus were considered false positives, we removed
    815 scaffolds shorter than 445Kb and accounting for 36 Mb of sequence."'
  Other observations: '"The hifiasm primary assembly was highly contiguous and complete.
    However, after performing a whole-genome alignment (WGA) against Phorcus lineatus
    (xgPhoLine1.1, with 15 MYA divergence) we observed high colinearity between the
    larger contigs in our assembly and the P. lineatus'' chromosomes, except for chromosome
    17. Thanks to the WGA, we indentified a 5Mb carrying the telomere end of the chromosome
    17 homologue and joined the two contigs (i.e. SUPER_17), ending up with 18 super-scaffolds.
    Given the little amount of sample received for the sequenced specimen, and the
    fact that a high proportion of snail shell was shattered and mixed with the remaining
    tissue, the cell lysate was not enough to obtain a HiC library. In absence of
    HiC data for this species, we mapped the available HiC reads for xgPhoLine1.1
    using a MQ threshold of 10 and obtaining more than 153.8 million valid pairs.
    The contact map confirms the chromosome territories and the likely-real chromosome
    inversions observed in the WGA between both species. Noticeably, 14 out of 18
    superscaffolds present telomere sequence peaks at both ends while the other 4
    have a peak at just one chromosome end. The shared folder contains these three
    evidences: 1. synteny: WGA ,2. telomeres, 3. hic of sister species. These are
    supporting the chromosome level assembly (xgPhoTurb1.1) presented here, that has
    identical observed haploid number to Phorcus lineatus. Thanks to the review process
    we removed 1 haplotig and placed to scaffolds into SUPERs. Regarding the organelles,
    we assembled the mitogenome using FOAM v0.5 into a single circular contig of 17,345
    bp staring with the trnF gene."'
