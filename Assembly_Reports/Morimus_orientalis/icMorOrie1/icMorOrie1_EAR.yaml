  Other observations: '"The assembly of Morimus orientalis (icMorOrie1) is based on
    55X PacBio data and Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/).The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 24 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 3.6 Mb (with the largest
    being 1.5Mb). Additionally, 358 regions totaling 36 Mb (with the largest being
    3.5 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial
    genome was assembled using OATK. Finally, the primary assembly was analyzed and
    manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, no haplotypic regions
    were removed. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C data were named in
    order of size. The X chromosome has been identified thanks to comparison with
    another insect genome assembly and the lower coverage in HiC data. But the Y chromosome
    has not been identified in the assembly even if the sepcimen collected was a male."'
