  Contamination notes: '"No contaminants were found with the pipeline NCBI FCS GX
    v Galaxy Version 0.5.5+galaxy1. No scaffolds are flagged as contaminants by BlobToolKit."'
  Other observations: '"Curation was done in two steps. 1)In a double haplotype contact
    map, the two haplotypes were checked to resolve haplotigs and construct an Hap1
    as complete as possible. The script MicroFinder.py was also used to help reconstruct
    the microchromosomes. The HiC contact was low, so to aid in reconstructing microchromosomes,
    an alignment was performed with the scaffold level genome ASM2856531v1 (GCA_028565315.1)
    of the same species. Another chromosome-level genome is at the moment available
    on NCBI (bScoRus3.2, GCA_964304615.2) 2) The Curation was done only on the most
    complete haplotype, in this case Hap1."'
