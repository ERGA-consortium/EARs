  EBP quality code:
    collapsed: 7.8.Q76

Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX detected four small bacterial contigs matching Knoellia
    remsis and Knoellia locipacati, and totalling 125,318 bp. These were removed from
    the assembly. Additionally, a 579,681 bp long contig was removed from the assembly
    during curation on the basis of skewed GC content, high coverage, very little
    Hi-C contact with the rest of the genome, and tiara classification as bacterial."'
  Other observations: '"The assembly was produced with hifiasm and the *p_ctg.fa was
    selected. The assembly was decontaminated with FCS-GX, and haplotigs purged with
    purge_dups. Scaffolding was performed with YaHS. Mitochondria was assembled with
    Oatk."'
