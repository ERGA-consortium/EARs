  Other observations: '"The assembly of Lyristes plebejus (ihLyrPleb1) is based on
    32X PacBio data and 307X Arima Hi-C data generated as part of the European Reference
    Genome Atlas (ERGA, https://www.erga-biodiversity.eu/) via the Biodiversity Genomics
    Europe project (BGE, https://biodiversitygenomics.eu/).The assembly process included
    the following steps: initial PacBio assembly generation with Hifiasm, removal
    of contaminant sequences using Context, removal of haplotypic duplications using
    purge_dups, and Hi-C-based scaffolding with YaHS. In total, 23 contigs were identified
    as contaminants (bacterial, archaeal, or viral), totaling 15 Mb (with the largest
    being 13.7 Mb). Additionally, 1273 regions totaling 288 Mb (with the largest being
    7.5 Mb) were identified as haplotypic duplications and removed. The mitochondrial
    genome was assembled using OATK (linear sequence). Finally, the primary assembly
    was analyzed and manually improved using Pretext. During manual curation, 1 haplotypic
    region was removed, totaling 7.4 Mb. Chromosome-scale scaffolds confirmed by Hi-C
    data were named in order of size"'
