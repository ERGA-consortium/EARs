Curator notes:
  Contamination notes: '"FCS-GX identified some small bacterial fragments, as well
    as two large circular contigs matching Spiroplasma and Wolbachia. The identity
    of these was confirmed though BLAST. The Spiroplasma genome is 2.48 Mb long with
    25.16% GC, and it has highest similarity to other Spiroplasma cobionts of bees
    such as Seladonia, Ammophila, and Lassioglossum. The Wolbachia genome is 1.34
    Mb long with 35.22% GC, and it has high similarity with other Wolbachia group
    A genomes from a wide range of insects."'
  Other observations: '"Assembly was performed with hifiasm using HiC data with the
    --h1/--h2 parameters. The collapsed p_ctg was selected based on N50/N90 and L50/L90
    stats. The genome seems to have only metacentric or sub-metacentric chromosomes
    and the gaps are usually near where the centromeres would be. Some putative peri-centromeric
    scaffolds could be assigned to chromosomes abeit with the unlocalized tag. Also,
    because it is common for non-homologous chromosomes to share repetitive DNA, some
    repetitive scaffolds were left unassigned to chromosomes because of this uncertainty.
    Karyotype is unkown but another genus from the same tribe (genus Lasioglossum,
    tribe Halictini) displays a wide range of karyotypes (n=6-20), so the GOAT ancestor
    inference is unlikely to be useful here."'
